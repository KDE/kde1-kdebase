<H3><A NAME="s3">3. Background</A></H3>

<P>
<P>The Background setup dialog is comprised of four sections:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Selection of the <B>Desktop</B> to configure.</LI>
<LI>The background <B>Preview Monitor</B>.</LI>
<LI>The background <B>Color</B>.</LI>
<LI>The background <B>Wallpaper</B>.</LI>
</OL>
<P>At the bottom of the screen the
option <B>Dock into the panel</B>
allows you to select whether an icon for
the Background  Display Setting dialog is docked into the Panel
(this provides quick access to the Display Settings menu,
and also allows stepping through changing background
sequences  when the ``<B>Random</B>'' background mode option
is selected).
<P>Also at the bottom of the screen is a slider
allowing the  memory <B>Cache size</B> used by the display to
be adjusted.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Selection of the Desktop to configure.</A>
</H3>

<P>The top left <B>Desktop</B> box lists the 
currently-configured desktops by their assigned names.
Click on a name to select the corresponding desktop to
be configured.   
<P>If you wish to configure a common background for
all Desktops, check  the <B>Common Background</B>
box.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Preview Monitor</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>This is a minature representation of your display background, using the
current settings.  To apply these settings to your display, press the
<B>Apply</B> button to continue using the KDE display setup utility, or the
<B>Ok</B> button to apply your changes and quit.
<P>
<P>
<P><EM>Note:</EM> Pressing <B>Ok</B> or <B>Apply</B> applies changes made in
<EM>all</EM> of the display setup modules.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Background Color</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The display background can be filled with a single color or with a color
gradient.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Select ``<B>One Color</B>'' to fill the background with a single color.
The background color can be changed by clicking on the colored box which
shows the currently-selected color.
This will display a color selection dialog from which
you may select a new background color.</LI>
<LI>Select ``<B>Two Color</B>''
to fill the background with a color gradient or pattern,
A second colored box will appear. 
Click on this box to select the second color.
Now click on the <B>Setup</B> button to choose how to
blend the two colors. A dialog and Preview box will appear.
You may choose to progressively blend the colors from 
<B>top to bottom</B> of the screen, from <B>right to left</B>, 
or in a <B>pattern</B> selected
from the list shown.   You will see a preview of the choice you make
before you apply it. Click <B>OK</B> or <B>Cancel</B> to leave
this dialog.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>When you are happy with your color selection, press <B>Ok</B> in the color
selection dialog.  The colors will be updated in the colored
boxes (and in the Preview
Monitor,  provided no Wallpaper is selected).
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>A blend of the two colors uses only 8 colors, leaving plenty free for other
applications. However, it requires an image the size of your display to be
maintained in memory.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Wallpaper</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The wallpaper is an image displayed in the background (root window) of your
display.  To change the wallpaper displayed, select one from the list
or click the <B>Browse</B> button and select an image.  If wish to
use a One Color or Two Color background, choose <CODE>No Wallpaper</CODE>. 
<P>
<P>Choose from the <B>Arrangement</B> list to select how the
wallpaper image is applied to the desktop: various tiling, mirroring, or
scaling schemes are possible, and their effects may be seen in 
the Preview box.
<P>
<P>You may also select the  <B>Random</B> option
which causes a random sequence
of backgrounds to be displayed, changing after a specified time
interval, or when you click on the  Display icon docked in the panel.
<P>To configure the random sequence of backgrounds:
<UL>
<LI> 
Click on the <B>Setup</B> button to open the
<B>Random mode setup</B> dialog, which allows you to select 
the sequence of backgrounds which is sampled.</LI>
<LI>If the option <B>Pick files from directory</B> is
selected, the backgrounds wil be
chosen from the set of wallpaper files in the selected directory
entered in the box that opens.
If this option is <B>not</B> selected, they will
be chosen from a list of backgrounds that can be specified in
the ``<B>Desktops</B>''  box below.</LI>
<LI>The <B>Timer Delay in seconds </B> box allows you to set
the time interval  between background changes.  
</LI>
<LI>The sequence
will be sampled randomly, unless you check the
``<B>in order</B>'' box, in which case the sequence
will be displayed in order.</LI>
<LI> The ``<B>Desktops</B>'' box contains the user-specified
sequence of  backgrounds that will be sampled if   ``<B>pick files
from directory</B>'' is <I>not</I> checked.
<UL>
<LI>To add an entry to this sequence, 
click on <B>Add</B>; this will add
a highlighted  <CODE>No Wallpaper</CODE> entry for the 
currently-selected Color background 
from the main Background <B>Display settings</B> screen to the sequence.</LI>
<LI>To replace  an
entry, first click on it to select it
(the selected item is highlighted).
Now go back to the main Background
<B>Display settings</B> screen 
(without closing the <B>Random mode setup</B> screen)
and deselect <B>Random</B>.
Whatever <B>Wallpaper</B> (including
<CODE>No Wallpaper</CODE>) you now select will replace the highlighted
entry in the Random Mode background sequence.
Click on <B>Delete</B> to remove the highlighted
item from the Random Mode backgrounds sequence.
In this way, you can construct any sequence of backgrounds
you wish.  Click on <B>OK</B> when you are satisfied with it.</LI>
<LI>Don't forget to reselect <B>Random</B> in the main Background
Display Setting screen to activate your Random Mode backgrounds.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>Displaying wallpaper requires that the image be kept in memory.  If you are low
on memory, using a small, tiled image or none at all is recommended. Note
that scaling or centering a small image still requires an image the size of
your display to be maintained in memory.
