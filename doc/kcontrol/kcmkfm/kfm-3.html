<P>
<UL>
<LI> Activating the "<B>Allow  per-URL settings</B>" button
allows you  to save KDE settings 
(e.g., whether menubar, toolbar, statusbar, and URL are
shown or hidden, the window size, all the options from the 'View' menu, ...)
as settings for a given URL. This can be, for example, any directory on your
disk where you have write access, or any URL (directory or even Web URL) which
has a shortcut on your desktop or which you have bookmarked.
</LI>
<LI> One of the KFM File Manager features is to display a view of
the directory tree in the left part of its window if "Show Tree"
in its "View"  menu is enabled.
If the "<B>Tree view follows navigation</B>" option is selected here, 
the tree view
of  directories you enter by clicking on their icons in 
the right part of the File Manger window will appear, 
and will continue to be displayed after you leave the directory.
You can then return 
to a previously-entered  directory easily, by clicking on its
entry in in the tree.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>You may also specify the terminal and editor applications
that  may be invoked by the File Manager:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>   
In the "<B>Terminal</B>" box, you can enter the command that
will be  executed to provide a terminal whenever you select
"Open Terminal" in the File Manager "File" menu, or when an application is
about to be run in a terminal by the file manager.
The default terminal application is <CODE>konsole</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>In the ``<B>Editor</B>'' box, you can enter the command that
will be used to  start an editor to view  <CODE>html</CODE>
source when the  File Manager's <B>View Frame Source</B>
or <B>View Document Source</B> ``View'' menu items are invoked.
The default editor is <CODE>kedit</CODE>.</LI>
