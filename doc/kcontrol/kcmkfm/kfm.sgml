<sect> KFM Configuration: Fonts
<p>
In this screen, you can customize the Fonts
used by the File Manager and other KDE applications.

<itemize>
<item>The "<bf>Font Size</bf> button selects between
Small/Medium/Large Font sizes.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Standard Font</bf>" list allows the
standard (proportional spacing) font to be chosen.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Fixed Font</bf>" list allows the
font for displaying text with fixed spacing  to be chosen.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Default Charset</bf>" list allows the
default character set  for displaying text to be chosen.
If "<bf>Use Language Charset</bf>" is chosen, no default character
set will be selected, and the character set appropriate
for your Language setting will be used.
</itemize>



<sect> KFM Configuration: Color
<p>
In this screen you can customize the File Manager
color settings.  When you click on a color box, the "Select
Color"screen allows you to select a color for the corresponding
item.

<itemize>
<item> "<bf>Background Color</bf>" 
is the color of the background
in a File Manager window.

<item> "<bf>Normal Text Color</bf>
is the color used for displaying normal 
text (i.e., text without hypertext links) 
within a hypertext document viewed with
the KDE File Manager and Browser, KFM.

<item> "<bf>URL Link Color</bf>" is the color
in which clickable hypertext links are
shown on pages viewed with the KDE File Manager 
and Browser (KFM),
<it>before</it> the link is followed.
Directory entries viewed with KFM are also
URL hypertext links.

<item> "<bf>Followed  Link Color</bf>" is the color
in which clickable  links are shown, <it>after</it> the
link has been followed, during the period that this
event is remembered.
</itemize>

Two further buttons control how links are displayed:

<itemize>
<item>If "<bf>Change cursor over link</bf>" is selected, the cursor
changes from an arrow to a pointing hand when it is
over a clickable link.

<item>If "<bf>Underline links</bf>" is selected, clickable
links are underlined.
</itemize>

The final button allows the user's default color scheme
to be forced;

<itemize>
<item> If "<bf>Always use my colors</bf>" is selected, 
the user's default color scheme will override any colors
specified by the web page.

</itemize>

<sect> KFM File Manager Configuration: Other
<p>
<itemize>
<item> Activating the "<bf>Allow  per-URL settings</bf>" button
allows you  to save KDE settings 
(e.g., whether menubar, toolbar, statusbar, and URL are
shown or hidden, the window size, all the options from the 'View' menu, ...)
as settings for a given URL. This can be, for example, any directory on your
disk where you have write access, or any URL (directory or even Web URL) which
has a shortcut on your desktop or which you have bookmarked.

<item> One of the KFM File Manager features is to display a view of
the directory tree in the left part of its window if "Show Tree"
in its "View"  menu is enabled.
If the "<bf>Tree view follows navigation</bf>" option is selected here, 
the tree view
of  directories you enter by clicking on their icons in 
the right part of the File Manger window will appear, 
and will continue to be displayed after you leave the directory.
You can then return 
to a previously-entered  directory easily, by clicking on its
entry in in the tree.

</itemize>

You may also specify the terminal and editor applications
that  may be invoked by the File Manager:

<itemize>
<item>   
In the "<bf>Terminal</bf>" box, you can enter the command that
will be  executed to provide a terminal whenever you select
"Open Terminal" in the File Manager "File" menu, or when an application is
about to be run in a terminal by the file manager.
The default terminal application is <tt>konsole</tt>.

<item>
In the ``<bf>Editor</bf>'' box, you can enter the command that
will be used to  start an editor to view  <tt>html</tt>
source when the  File Manager's <bf>View Frame Source</bf>
or <bf>View Document Source</bf> ``View'' menu items are invoked.
The default editor is <tt>kedit</tt>.
</itemize>


<sect> KFM Web Browser Configuration: Proxy
<p>

This screen configures the KFM browser to use a Proxy-server.
You might want to use a Proxy-server if you are connected to the Internet 
via a firewall or via a (slow) dial-up connection. 
Most ISPs have a proxy-server available for their customers. 
Ask your ISP for the settings mentioned here.

If you click on the "<bf>Use proxy</bf>" button to activate it, 
HTTP and FTP connections
will by default 
be made via a proxy-server which runs on the specified proxy-hosts.

If the "use proxy" button is activated, you can specify  
the proxy-host to use for HTTP connections in the
<bf>HTTP Proxy</bf> box. You can
either specify the hostname or the IP-number of the proxy host.
The "<bf>Port</bf>" box next to it allows you to specify the port on 
the proxy-host which provides access to the proxy-server. 
Most HTTP proxy-servers use port 8080.

Use the <bf>FTP proxy</bf> box, and the <bf>Port</bf> box next to it,
to specify the proxy-host and port to use for 
FTP connections. (To use the same setting for the FTP and HTTP
proxy, click on the arrow button next to the HTTP Port; this copies
the HTTP proxy entries to the FTP ones).


The box labeled "<bf>No proxy for:</bf>" 
defines a list of hosts and/or domains for which the proxy 
should <bf>not</bf> be used. 
The list may be separated either by commas or by spaces.
If a hostname or a part of the hostname occurs in the list, no proxy-server
will be used for connections to this host.

This option is useful if you want to access hosts which your computer knows 
about but which are unknown to the proxy-server or which give problems when
acccessed via the proxy-server. Typically you want to 
add '<tt>localhost</tt>' here.


<sect> KFM Web Browser Configuration: HTTP
<p>

This screen allows you to configure certain browser options.

Some Web sites are able to send versions of a given  html document in 
different languages. You can specify your list of preferred languages in the
"<bf>Accept Languages</bf>" box. The list is in 
decreasing order of preference, e.g. the first language is the most preferable.
You can use the asterisk ("<bf> * </bf>") to specify 'any' language.

A language should be specified with its 2-digit abbreviation. Examples are:
<itemize>
<item> <tt>en</tt> =	English
<item> <tt>de</tt> =    German
<item> <tt>fr</tt> =	French
<item> <tt>nl</tt> =	Dutch
</itemize>

The box "<bf>Accept character sets:</bf>" allows you
to  list the character sets which are accepted by the browser.
You can use the asterisk  ("<bf> * </bf>") to specify 'any' charset.

Not all www-servers send correct information about the contents of documents.
If the "<bf>Assume HTML</bf>" option is enabled, all data received via HTTP 
is assumed to be HTML unless the remote www-server defined it otherwise. 

If opening a webpage from a remote web-site results in a 'Open with' dialog 
box, you might want to try this option. 



<sect> KFM Web Browser Configuration: User Agent
<p>

When requesting web pages, Web Browsers identify themselves to Web Servers by 
reporting
their name and version as a  <bf>User-Agent String</bf>.
The default User-Agent string for KFM is set to <bf>Konqueror</bf>
plus version information.
(The Conqueror is the next in the
sequence Navigator - Explorer - ...  !)

You can also configure the KFM Browser to report a different User-Agent String
to a specfic web sites,  while reporting the default string to other
sites. 
The usefulness of this is that web servers may decide
on what form to send the information (e.g., frames or
no frames) depending on which browser application it
thinks it is talking to.  

The KFM Browser is perfectly capable of handling frames,
but this  may not be known to a web site that only sends frames
to browsers it thinks can handle them.  In such a case,
you can configure KFM so that for that particular site,
it reports the User-Agent String of another well-known browser such
as <bf>Netscape Navigator</bf> (tm), 
which has user-agent string "<bf>Mozilla</bf>", plus version information,
or <bf>Interner Explorer</bf>(tm).

To create a binding between a User-Agent String and a web site:
<itemize>
<item> enter the address of the website in the box labelled 
"<bf>On Server:</bf>"
<item> enter the desired User-Agent String in the box labelled
"<bf>Login as:</bf>"
<item> Click on the <bf>Add</bf> button.
</itemize>

To remove such a binding, click on its entry in the list of 
<bf>Known bindings</bf> to highlight it, then 
click on the <bf>Delete</bf> button.

To activate your changes, click on <bf>Apply</bf> or
<bf>OK</bf>.  To exit without applying the changes, click on
<bf>Cancel</bf>.


<sect> KFM Web Browser Configuration: Cookies
<p>

``<bf>Cookies</bf>'' are little messages you receive from a 
remote website which are intended to be stored on your
system, and  sent
back by your browser to that site the next time you visit it 
(or when you visit
another page on the site). 

Cookies can be used by websites to automatically
identify you for a longer period of time. A website can use this to store
your preferences. Cookies can also be used to track your behaviour
on a site. Used as such, some people consider cookies an attack on their
privacy. KFM offers you a broad range of possibilities to decide which cookies
you want to receive and which you don't.  

If ``<bf>Enable Cookies</bf>'' is activated,  cookies will be accepted 
according to the following settings and
stored cookies will be sent.
If it is <bf>not</bf> activated, no cookie will ever be sent, 
and no new cookies will be accepted.

The ``<bf>default accept policy</bf>'' setting
defines what to do with cookies which do not originate from
a domain which has a domain-specific setting. 
<itemize>
<item> "<bf>Accept</bf>" will accept all cookies received without 
notifying the user.
<item> ``<bf>Ask</bf>'' will open a popup box to
ask the user what to do, each time
a cookie is received.
<item> ``<bf>Reject</bf>'' will reject all cookies received without 
notifying the user.
</itemize>

You may set specific policies for  how to treat cookies received
from domains listed in the ``<bf>Domain specific settings</bf>'' box.

To add such a domain, type its name in the 
``<bf>change domain accept policy</bf>'' box, and click on one of the
three policies (<bf>accept/ask/reject</bf>). Then click on 
``<bf>change</bf>'' to add the new entry to the list of domain-specific
settings.    To modify the entry for an exiting domain in the list,
click on it to highlight it, then set a new cookie acceptance policy for it, 
or click on <bf>delete</bf> to remove it.

Cookies originating from one of these domains will be treated according to the
policy set for them. 
When you have selected ``<bf>ask</bf>'' for a domain you will get a 
popup window when
a cookie is received from this domain, which asks you what to do
with the cookie. This popup window can also be used to change the acceptance 
policy for the domain. 


<sect> KFM Configuration: Desktop Icons
<p>
In this screen, you can control the default spacing of the icons
on your KDE desktop, and how their names are displayed.

<itemize>
<item> Specify the ``<bf>Horizontal Root Grid Spacing</bf>'' and
the  ``<bf>Vertical Root Grid Spacing</bf>'' to chose the hidden
grid on which the desktop icons will, by default,  be placed.

<item> The icon names appear as text below the icon. 
By default, the text appears on a small opaque rectangular
background that hides the Desktop wallpaper below. 
To remove this background, activate 
``<bf>Transparent Text for Desktop Icons</bf>''.

<item> Click on the ``<bf>Icon foreground color</bf>'' box to 
chose the color of the text giving the icon name.

<item> Click on the box ``<bf>Icon background color</bf>'' to 
chose the color of the background on  which the icon name is written.
(Inactive if "Transparent Text for Desktop Icons" is selected.)

<item> You may also choose activate the feature ``<bf>Show
Hidden Files on Desktop</bf>''.

</itemize>

Click on "<bf>Apply</bf>" to apply configuration changes to
your current desktop.   "<bf>OK</bf>" applies the changes and  exits,
while "<bf>Cancel</bf>" exits without applying the changes.
