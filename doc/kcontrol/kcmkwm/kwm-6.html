<H3><A NAME="s6">6. Advanced Window Manager Settings.</A></H3>

<P>This screen allows you to configure various
advanced Window Manager features.
<P>In the <B>Keyboard and Mouse</B> settings:
<UL>
<LI>If <B>Ctrl-Tab walks through desktops</B> is selected,
this key combination can be used to switch desktops.</LI>
<LI> The Alt+Tab key combination is used to switch focus
between different windows, making each window active in turn.  
If <B>Alt-Tab is limited to current desktop</B> is selected,
only the open windows in the current desktop will be
cycled through.   Using the <B>Alt-Tab mode</B>
list box, the action of the Alt-Tab key can be chosen to
be in the graphical KDE style, or the "Classic" CDE style. 
The KDE-style Alt-Tab mode assures that using successive isolated Alt-Tab
key combination will permit to switch between two alternate windows.
Keeping the Alt key pressed and consecutively pressing Tab will allow
to browse the list of available windows. The CDE-style Alt-Tab mode
is different in the way isolated Alt-Tab presses act. Windows are always
browsed successively.
</LI>
<LI> The <B>Grab the Right Mouse Button</B> setting is <B>on</B>
by default. This option was introduced because a number of non-KDE X Window
applications need to have complete control on the use of the right mouse
button (for example Gimp).  Deselect this option to allow non-KDE
X Window applications to control the right mouse button.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The <B>Filters</B> settings offer the ability to allow windows 
with particular window titles or X class names to be configured
differently from the default window configuration.
<P>Windows with Titles
or X class name that match a list item can have one of these special
properties: they can be configured so they
<UL>
<LI>get only tiny decorations</LI>
<LI>get no decorations</LI>
<LI>never get focus</LI>
<LI>start as Sticky</LI>
<LI>are excluded from session management</LI>
</UL>
<P>To make an entry in the list, enter a Title or Class  in the appropriate
box, and click on the "+" button.
Then click on it to highlight it, and select a special property.
<P>To remove an entry, double-click on it to select it,
then press the "-" button.
