<H3><A NAME="s5">5. Frequently Asked Questions</A></H3>

<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Why should I use <EM>kwm</EM>?</A>
</H3>

<P>I spent several days in learning how to
configure 10 different window mangers. Now that I have 678
lines of resource files doing exactly what I want, you are coming
along and want to take my window manager away!
<P><B>Answer</B>: You <EM>should</EM> not, it is only a <EM>free</EM>
offer.  KDE supports all current window managers, but to get the full
benefits it is recommended you use <EM>kwm</EM>.  See the list of 
<A HREF="index-1.html#Features">Features</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Why can't I define new shortcuts for launching applications?</A>
</H3>

<P><B>Answer</B>: Because this is not the task of the
window manager. Use <CODE>KGlobalShortcut</CODE> for this
purpose.
<H3><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Why does <EM>kwm</EM> look so much like Windows 95?</A>
</H3>

<P><B>Answer</B>: Ooops, does it? Let me see.... (Matthias trying to
find somebody
who has Windows 95 because he does not have Windows 95 on any his
computers, ummm nobody has Windows 95 here. Well let's grab an old
Linux distribution and install fvwm95-2.....) No, I can not verify
that at all. KWM looks much prettier and offers more core
window management functionality.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Is it possible to add KDE extensions to other window managers? </A>
</H3>

<P><B>Answer</B>: Yes it is.  You simply have to go through
<CODE>kwm.h</CODE> and <CODE>kwm.C</CODE> from <CODE>libkdecore</CODE> and
extend your favorite
window manager to respond correctly to these requests. 
It is also possible to implement an object request broker in
x86 assembler. It's just a question of the investment/result
ratio.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Does <EM>kwm</EM> support shaded windows a la <EM>OpenStep</EM>?</A>
</H3>

<P><B>Answer</B>: Yes.
