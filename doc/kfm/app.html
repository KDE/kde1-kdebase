<h2>How to install a new application</h2>
<p>Every KDE application should come with its configuration
files so there is no need for the user to edit them. But unless
every distribution is KDE ready you may want to configure
existing applications to work with KDE. In this lesson we
try to install XV in the K Desktop Environment.</p>
<h2>Why and where</h2>
<p>Every application must put a config file in the directory
tree <tt>$KDEDIR/share/applnk</tt>. KFM and KPanel scan these
files on startup. KPanels system menu corresponds to this
directory structure. The icons in this directory behave like
real applications. You can click on them to start the
application and you may drop files on them. It is sometimes
a good idea to have such config files outside the <tt>applnk</tt>
tree. They work in every directory, but only the ones in the
<tt>applnk</tt> directory are scanned in on startup. So if you
want to install for example XV as the default app for images, then
you must move the config file inside this special tree. But perhaps
there are some apps which you dont want to appear in KFM or KPanel
but on your desktop, then you may of course create such config files
on your desktop or elsewhere. The procedure is almost the same as the
one we are describing here.</p>
<p>If KFM find a file it first tries to find out about its data
type ( see <a href="mime.html">mime types</a> for more information ).
After doing so it searches all applications which regsitered for this
data type. If none is found the user is prompted. If only one is found
or a default on was specified ( see <a href="mime.html">mime types</a> for
more information ), KFM will use this one, otherwise KFM will make a
guess. Using the right popup menu will show you a selection of all
applications which registered for this data type.</p>
<h2>Step by step</h2>
<p>You may now continue with the <a href="app2.html">next chapter</a> while
the hackers and developers may want to learn more internals.</p>
<h2>Hackers</h2>
<p>The config file we want to create will look like this:</p>
<pre>
# KDE Config File
[KDE Desktop Entry]
BinaryPattern=xv;
MimeType=image/gif;image/jpeg;image/tiff;image/x-xbm;image/x-xpm;
Comment=XV Image App
Comment[de]=XV Graphik Programm
Exec=xv %f
TerminalOptions=
Icon=image.xpm
Path=
Type=Application
Terminal=0
</pre>
<p>The first line contains some magic bytes and
the second line contains a <tt>;</tt> separated list of names that
the binary of this application may have. This way the binary gets a nice
icon, too. The next line conatins a list of all mime types the app can
handle, followed by the usual comments in different languages.
the <tt>Exec</tt> tag contains the shell quoted command that will
be executed to start the application. The <tt>%f</tt> is going to be replaced
by the documents filenames, but see the next chapter for more details.
The <tt>Type</tt> tag is needed like in every KFM config file. You can
tell KFM to start the app in a terminal by setting <tt>Terminal</tt> to
1 and by setting some terminal options if needed. In addition the
<tt>Path</tt> tag allows you to specify a working directory.</p>
<h2>Secret tips</h2>
<p>Most old style apps may need the <tt>%f</tt> argument. This means that
they can only accept files on the local hard disks. If you use URLs
never the less, KFM will download the files first and start the application
afterwards. If the files are modified by the app, the user is prompted wether
he wants them to be uploaded.</p>
<p>You may enter <tt>%u</tt> instead of <tt>%f</tt>. This will cause KFM to
pass URLs to the application. External files are not preloaded. Some KDE
apps support this cool feature.</p>
<p>There are addtional tags you may use. Here is a short list
<ul>
<li><b><tt>%k</tt></b> The path and name of the config file itself.
This is useful if the app you want to start should read/modify the
config file that started it. This way you can for example implement 
simple printer representations. The same file that repesents the
printer on your desktop stores your prefered printer settings. Use <tt>%k</tt>
to pass the config file to the printer GUI.
<li><b><tt>%n</tt></b> The filename of the documents without path.
<li><b><tt>%d</tt></b> The path of the documents without file name.
The <tt>%d</tt> and the <tt>%n</tt> tag together are the same
as <tt>%f</tt>.
<li><b><tt>%c</tt></b> Name of the application. This is the name of
the config file itself without path and extension. This way you can set
the title of the application.
<ul>
