KDE Screen Saver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is kscreensaver.. screen savers for KDE.  The timeout stuff is based
on a very heavily modified xautolock.

Features:

* Each screen saver is a stand-alone executable.
* Each screen saver has a setup dialog.
* Interfaces with kdisplay, so no manual setup of screen saver is necessary.
* Hotspots in corners of display to invoke saver/locker.
* Copy kscreensaver.h/cpp to your app and call kForceLock() to lock the
  screen any time.
(or just run klock)

Installation:

You will require kdelibs from KDE Version 1.1 or newer

Since this is now part of kdebase, please check the top level directory
(e.g. ../) for more information.

Adding (Coding.. Porting..) New Screensavers:

To add your own screen savers you must provide four functions:

void startScreenSaver( Drawable d );

  Start the screen saver in the specified window if it is not currently
  running.

void stopScreenSaver();

  Stop the screen saver if it is currently running.

int  setupScreenSaver();

  Display a dialog so the the user can change the screen saver settings.

const char *getScreenSaverName()

  return the name/description of the screen saver


All drawing must be done in Xlib.
use blankscrn.*, polygon.* and banner.* as examples.
Naming the screensavers *.kss1 allows kdisplay to locate the available
screensavers.

blank, banner and polygons are my fault


TODO:

More screen savers - If you plan to write/port a screen saver, please let
  me know what you are doing so that effort is not duplicated.
Support multiple screens - I can't do this - I only have one.
