kwmcom is a tiny shell tool which sends commands to kwm via
KWM::sendKWMCommand. Kwm will send all commands which it does not
understand to its modules. The module "kpanel" can for example
be restarted with "kwmcom kpanel:restart".

KDE applications itself should not use kwmcom, but use the class KWM
(which is a part of libkdecore) instead.

Nevertheless kwmcom might be usefull anyway, for example for kwm
module programmers. The KWMModuleApplication-class will emit a signal
commandRecieved(QString) when a command arrives.

Note that <command> is limited to 19 character due to the usage of
XClientMessages.
