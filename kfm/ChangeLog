1999-02-18  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kioserver.cpp (getDestNameForLink): Completely changed the behaviour.
	 The old code resulted in a filename like "ftp:filename.ext"
	 instead of "ftp://host/path/filename.ext"
	 Used bookmark code for encoding instead.

1999-02-16  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmgui.cpp (showSource): Added option Editor to choose the preferred 
	editor used by Show Document / Frame source. Defaults to kedit.
	Idea from Dawit A.

1999-02-01  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfm*: Copy/Paste for text (browser mode) as well as URLs (file
	manager mode). Enabled/Disabled menu items as one would expect.
	(Initial patch from Dawit A.)

1999-01-19  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kiojob.cpp: Show 'not implemented' when trying to download a remote 
	directory or upload a directory to a remote location.
	
	* kioserver.cpp: Use DirectoryEntries cache for isDir, if nothing better.

1999-01-18  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kbind.cpp: Open Properties when left-clicking a mimetype file.
	
	* kfmgui.cpp: Reduce bookmark text size if >40. New function in utils.*

1999-01-15  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmgui.cpp: Patch 15 from Michael Reiher :
	Passes the current path to kfind so that it sets
	it as default search path

1999-01-14  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmgui.*: Store bHtmlMode, useful to know which mode we're in.
	Allow Ctrl+Delete for deleting files, improved Ctrl+A handling.

1999-01-13  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kiojob.cpp: Patch from Waldo Bastian. Now kfm copies/moves
	symlinks as symlinks in local->local copies. It also checks for
 	pipes/sockets/fifo/device files and refuses to copy/move them.

	* kfmman.cpp (openURL): special case for the cache directory :
	save contents of the cache to index.html before opening the URL.

	* kfmgui.cpp (slotClearCache): notify windows showing the cache.

	* kfmexec.*: Let the job finish, don't stop it after the first dir
 	returned. This fixes lots of problems, including opening ftp locations 
	twice from minicli (this used to sigsegv), only one directory 
	displayed instead of all of them, ...
	
	* *: replaced .data() with .copy() after localkdedir, before +=.

1999-01-11  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kioslave/ftp.cpp: Follow links on ftp site. Fix found by 
	Sven Fischer <herpes@kawo2.rwth-aachen.de> (kb1551).
	I also removed calls to ksprintf (less secure than +=).

	* kioslave/file.cpp (OpenDir): Added a cache to reduce calls to 
	getpwuid and getgrgid. Improves speed, esp for NIS users (kb1536).
	Initial patch from Philipp Hullmann <hullmann@nano.uni-hannover.de>.

	* kbind.cpp: Store and use terminal settings (set in applnks) in
	KMimeBind.
	* kbind.h: Made findType private and called getMagicMimeType
	instead. Fixes the text in the status bar, and the hint for root icons.

1999-01-07  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kioslave/file.cpp (OpenDir): Added redirection if HTML View set and
 	opening index.html or .kde.html

1999-01-06  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmprops.*: Commented out the "Working Directory" line edit. It
	isn't used at all. Thanks to the old kb1297.

	* kioslave/ftp_proxy.cpp: Lots of fixes.

1999-01-04  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmgui.cpp: Fixed Tree View being initialized even if not shown.
	This speeds up A LOT navigation in kfm !
	
	* kfmserver.cpp: Applied patch from Andreas Pour for better magic
	file creation. (Removes annoying dialog box at startup).

	* kioslave/tar.cpp: Fixed tar protocol support. Uses sscanf
	instead of strtok. Should work with GNU tar and non-GNU tar, which 
	have a different date format.
	
1999-01-03  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmgui.cpp: Argh, another late bug. When entering a directory in
	a window, all other windows had out-of-date history menus (and
	clicking on one item brought you to another item!). Fixed by
	connecting an AboutToShow for the Go menu to a new method filling
	the go menu (slotUpdateHistoryMenu), taken out from slotUpdateHistory. 

	* krenamewin.cpp, kiojob.cpp: Made window always modal.
	The modal argument is used to know whether to call done(x) or emit
	result(...). Fixes bug introduced by Preston when copying and
	overwriting destination. Thanks Torsten Rahn for reporting.

1998-12-22  Alex Zepeda  <garbanzo@hooked.net>

	* kioslave/ftp_proxy.cpp: Add proper line termination to user
	agent string, so reloading should work?
	* kioslave/http.cpp, http.h: Initial implementation of selectable
	user agent strings.  Also, make sure a connections are not persistant,
	as we're HTTP 1.0 compliant only.  For the time being.
	* config-kfm.h: Make the user-agent string work w/ the very
	pedantic egcs.

1998-12-21  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* passworddialog.cpp : Added layout management
	* More patches from Michael Reiher concerning the tree view
	* .directory for ~/Desktop, copied at kfm startup (Michael Reiher)

1998-12-20  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmman.cpp : Reload doesn't bring to beginning of the page anymore
	* Lots of bugfixes :
	 - Fixes in the tree view (Michael Reiher)
	 - Using KStdAccel in kfm (allows to change key bindings)
	 - Desktop icon placement in Mac mode fixed
	 - Fixed setting of SUID and SGID and group at the same time
	 - Fix Ctrl+A in the URL qlineedit
	 - Decode URL before showing them (in the title or in the URL qlineedit)
	 - Fixes concerning mini-icons for directories (thanks to Michael Reiher)
	 - Removed useless dialog boxes when kfm is started for the first time
	    except "creating ~/Desktop".
	 - Allow show/hide '.*' files from Desktop. (Michael Reiher)
	* Waldo Bastian : 
	Handle redirect during COPY (used for images/view document source)

1998-12-15  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* main.cpp : Test for KDE release, and copy new Templates it
	necessary. Patch from Michael Reiher <michael.reiher@gmx.de>
	* popup.cpp : Use "Name" field from Template files, not "Comment".

1998-12-14  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Sven Radej added fusion of global & local mimetypes (same for applications) :
	"Whenever you open global or local mimelnk dir, first local and then global
	mimelink dir is scanned and all items are shown like they are in your local
	dir; duplicated entries from global dir are discarded. You can try to delete
	or move to trash any of them; if they are your local copy they will be
	deleted, (although you will continue to see global one). If they are not your
	local copy normal error is issued (Cannot move, bla, bly permission denied).
	This works for mime *and* applnk directories."

1998-12-13  Waldo Bastian  <bastian@kde.org>

        * Created popup window asking the user what to do with incoming
        HTTP-cookies.

        * Fixed timezone bug in kcookiejar.cpp (BSD only). 

1998-12-12  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* popup.cpp, popup.h : Created for the KNewMenu class. Moved code
	from kfmgui.cpp, root.cpp, kfmtree.cpp, kfmman.cpp
	This improves maintenance (code in one place), binary size (again), and fixes
	the "new templates not being shown" bug, reported by Jason Boxman <benefits@cybertechs.com>

1998-12-09  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Removed all the files containing the old 'configure browser'
	dialog box. Everything is now in kcmkfm.
	There are now two menu entries : Configure File Manager... and
	Configure Browser... which call kcmkfm with different options.
	
	* kfmgui.cpp, kfmman.*, kfmtree.*:
	Patch from Michael Reiher <michael.reiher@gmx.de> to use i18n'ed comments
        instead of filenames in the 'New' menu. Looks a lot better :)

	* kfmman.cpp: Fixed Visual Schnauzer for files with special chars
	such as "'". Bug reported by Christian Fertig
	<fertig@informatik.uni-frankfurt.de>.
	
	* kfmgui.cpp: Added slotConfigure, which re-reads the
	configuration and applies it.

1998-12-07  Alex Zepeda  <garbanzo@hooked.net>

	* kbind.cpp: Quashed another "uninitalized" variable.

1998-12-07  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Delete showConfigUI from kfmclient options. Added configure
	instead. Will be used to re-read KFM configuration. Still todo.
	
1998-12-03  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmgui.cpp : Added Go menu, with up/back/forward/home and the last 10 history URLs.

1998-12-01  Waldo Bastian <bastian@kde.org>
    
        * Added HTTP-cookies. They don't get saved and they are always on 
        and they scream for some additional configuration.

1998-11-29  Alex Zepeda  <garbanzo@hooked.net>

	* kbind.cpp: Sort include headers, and correctly include a file to
	get MAX_PATH or whatever we were looking for.

1998-11-28  Kurt Granroth <granroth@kde.org>

   * KFM will now use 'KCursor::handCursor()' if the user chooses the
	  'change cursor over link' option.

1998-11-28  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Applied and adapted patches from <rjakob@duffy1.franken.de>:
	- KFM sets working directory when launching an application.
	- Default mimetype (not tested)
	- KFM tree view follow mode (add kfm_tree_follow=On in [Settings] in 
	  your kfmrc to enable it - at the moment). Some repaint problems, 
	  but works.
	* Removed fileentry.cpp / fileentry.h, not used (in this directory)

1998-11-26  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kioslave/file.cpp : Sort links to dirs with dirs. Fixed sorting of dirs themselves.

1998-11-25  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmman.cpp : Added key navigation (mostly in khtmlw, but also a bit in kfm)

1998-11-21 Lars Knoll <knoll@mpi-hd.mpg.de>
	* added support for url redirections
	  (<meta http-equiv="refresh" ...>) command

1998-11-19  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Deleted the Properties instance when finished with it (in slotApply/Cancel)
	Thanks to Pietro Iglio <iglio@fub.it> for reporting this memory leak. 
	* Commit Lars Knoll's change to add document encoding selection.
	
1998-11-18  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

1998-11-14  Cristian Tibirna  <ctibirna@gch.ulaval.ca>

	* layout management for *all* the Browser Configuration dialog
		tabs - still a problem with KTabCtl layout width.
	* added "showConfigUI" option to kfmclient.

1998-11-12  Cristian Tibirna  <ctibirna@gch.ulaval.ca>

	* color selection GUI for the root icons (in htmlopts.cpp, root.cpp,
 		kfmgui.cpp and so on :-)

1998-11-10  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kfmexec.cpp (slotMimeType): Fixed bug with OpenWithDlg
	  popuing up when opening remote documents that are not HTML
	  documents, but images for example.

	* kfmgui.cpp (slotQuit): Adaptions for shutdown stuff.

	* main.cpp (sig_term_handler): Adaptions for shutdown stuff.

	* kfmview.cpp (slotDropEvent): DnD Fix. Dropping icons from
	  kmail or ksysv do not crash kfm any more.

	* root.cpp (slotDropEvent): DnD Fix. Dropping icons from
	  kmail or ksysv do not crash kfm any more.

Sat Jun 27 18:11:23 1998 Carsten Pfeiffer <carpdjih@sp.zrz.tu-berlin.de>

	* kfmman.cpp (openPopupMenu): fixed multiple equal entries in 
	  popupmenu when several files of same mimetype are selected.

Fri Jun 26 17:20:03 1998    <weis@snoopy.rz.uni-frankfurt.de>

	* open-with.cpp (KAppTreeListItem): Fixed seg fault with
	  empty directory.

	* kfmgui.cpp (slotPannerChanged): Fixed bug with the panner.
	  If you resize the panner then the menu item will be set
	  accordingly. 

Sun Jun 21 00:08:32 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* kioslave/icon.cpp (Open): Fixed little QString bug

	* kfmman.cpp (slotMimeType): Made it work with the new goodie.

	* kfmview.cpp (slotPopupOpenWith): Made it work with the new goodie.

	* kfmprops.cpp (BindingPropsPage): Made it work with the changes
	  in kbind.cpp/h

	  Some cleanups.

	* kfmdlg.cpp (OpenWithDlg): Added a little goodie :-)

	* bookmark.cpp (KBookmark): Removed debug output

	* main.cpp (main): sockets do now have the name
	  /tmp/kfm_uid_pid_display and /tmp/kio_uid_pid_display.
	  This solves problems with sockets names used by other
	  users. This should solve the problem that is sometimes
	  unable to connect/create is socket.

	* kioslave/main.cpp (main): Uses KApplication instead of
	  QApplication now.

	* kioslave/icon.cpp (Open): Uses kapp->localkdedir()

Sat Jun 20 22:04:25 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* bookmark.cpp (scanIntern): You can now link from the bookmarks
	  to the home directory without seeing infinite recursion.
	  ( Some people do crazy things )

	* root.cpp (update): Removed all ".kde" dependencies

	* bookmark.cpp (scanIntern): Fixed bug with too many open files/directories

	* main.cpp (main): Uses kapp->localkdedir.

	* bookmark.cpp (scanIntern): Accept only regular files as
	  bookmarks. Skip fifos, pipes etc.

	* kfmjob.cpp (browse): Reset error flag. Entering an invalid URL
	  brings up a window. After that you could not open any other
	  file. This is fixed now.

	* bookmark.cpp (scanIntern): Check wether a file is really a kde
	  config file
	
	* bookmark.cpp (KBookmarkManager): Uses kapp->localkdedir()

Tue Jun 16 16:04:12 1998  Jacek Konieczny <jajcus@zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl>

	* kioslave/http.cpp
	  Changed error handling - do not return with FAIL, but read the
	  data anyway. There may be a good explanation what is happening.

	* kioslave/http.h, kioslave/http.cpp
	  Added some HTTP options: Charset and Language negotiation
	  and assuming HTTP data as HTML when no Content-Type field.

	* kkfmoptdlg.cpp, kkfmoptdlg.h, kfmgui.cpp, Makefile.am,
	  khttpoptdlg.h, khttpoptdlg.cpp
	  Added HTTP configuration dialog	

Mon Jun 15 03:21:12 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* kbind.cpp (initMimeTypes): Uses KSimpleConfig in
	  readonly mode everywhere => hopefully faster.
	  But it is fast on my machine anyway :-)
	
	* kfm.cpp (slotSave): The sockets are deleted if the
	  session management tells KFM to quit itself.

	* main.cpp (sig_term_handler): If KFM gets the TERM signal
	  it removes the sockest from the temp directory and saves
	  the cache index.

	* kfm.cpp (slotInstallSegfaultHandler): Immortality bug fix.
	  If KFM runs for 60 secs and segfaults then it restarts itself.
	  You can turn this off with "kfm -debug".

	* xview.cpp: Some cleanups, removed debug code

	* kfmman.cpp (writeEntry): Fixed bug in visual schnauzer
	  HTML generation. Looks better now.

	* kfmpaths.cpp (initPaths): Added CachePath

	* htmlcache.cpp: Moved cache to "/tmp/kfm-cache-<uid>/".
	  Cache is cleaned up properly now.
	  You may log in as the same user in an UNIX cluster on
	  different machines without disturbing the caches.
	  Little code cleanups.
	  Clearing of the cache does now really work.
	
Thu Jun 11 15:14:57 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* kfmgui.cpp: New keyboard shortcuts ( very useful! )
	  They are documented in the new docu pages.
	  In addition there is a little docu about bookmarks now.

Tue Jun  9 16:30:00 1998  Jacek Konieczny  <jajcus@zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl>

	* htmlcache.cpp, htmlcache.h, kfmgui.cpp, kfmgui.h
	  Added "Cache/Always save cache" and "Cache/Never save cache" options
	  and saving cache settings.

	* kioslave/manage.cpp
	  Fixed bug which caused KProtocolProxy beeing used even when
	  proxy was disabled. This made HTTP connection established instead
	  of FTP.

 	* kioslave/ftp_proxy.cpp, kioslave/ftp_proxy.h
	  Reopen support for proxy'ed FTP protocol
 
 	* kioslave/http.cpp, kioslave/http.h
	  Reopen support for HTTP protocol
 
	* ipcc/kio.ipc, kfmjob.cpp, kfmjob.h, kiojob.cpp, kiojob.h,
	  kioslave/main.cpp, kioslave/main.h, kioslave/protocol.cpp,
	  kioslave/protocol.h
	  Reload call added to kioslave, and reopen to kprotocol.
	  Theese are called when reload button is hit to get not
	  cached version of file

Wed May  6 19:40:40 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* kiojob.cpp (KIOJob): Hopefully I killed all kioslaves yet :-)
          I can hit forward and backward buttons like mad and nothing
	  segfaults. Decreased kioslave kill time to 10 sec ( change that
	  in kioserver.cpp for slow computers.
	
	* kioserver.cpp (slotTimer): Old kioslaves are deleted.
	  So no kioslaves stays longer then 60sec without doing
	  anything.

	* kiojob.cpp (cancel): Hopefully less kioslaves now.
	  Inserted "waitpid" after kill. Now KFM can not create
	  a new kioslave until the interrupted one is really dead.

	* kfmman.cpp (writeBeginning): KFM has now a "Up" Button.
	  No one can by accident select the ".." now, since this
	  always ends up in crazy things.

Sun May  3 15:40:05 1998

        * htmlopts.cpp (getMiscOpts): Fixed the "changed" check
          
        * kproxydlg.cpp, kkfmoptdlg.cpp, kfmgui.cpp:
          Made some code cleanups. Now it looks better :-)

	* kfmprops.cpp (applyChanges): Fixed directory renaming bug.

Sat Apr 18 00:05:41 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	  is emitted.

	* kfmjob.cpp (slotFinished): Fixed bug with multiple error
	  messages if directory is not accessible.

	* kURLcompletion.cpp (make_rotation): Fixed completion.
	  Now we complete diretories "/dir1/dir2/..." instead
	  of "file:/dir1/dir2/...." to avoid encoding problems.

Thu Apr 16 04:10:25 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* kfmman.cpp (writeEntry): New View ( short view ).

	* kfmprops.cpp (applyChanges): Sets icon and miniicon equal.
	  In the past miniicon was not set at all.
	
	* kiojob.cpp (move): Serious bug in file moving code solved.
	  Renaming the destination does now work. The existing file is
	  not overwritten ( expect the user wants KFM to do so ).

	* kfmgui.cpp (slotQuit): KFM does Session Management, too,
	  when the user selects the menu item "Quit".

	* kioslave/tar.cpp (ReadDir): Null pointer bug fix. Caused
	  problems on suns.

	* kbind.cpp (getPixmapFile): Some fixes ( encode/decode ).
	  Uses KSimpleConfig in read only mode. This is hopefully faster.

	* bookmark.cpp (scanIntern): Fixed bug that added some ugly
	  lines to every file in the bookmarks tree.

	* kioslave/file.cpp (OpenDir): kioslave just reports file names.
	  filenames are no URLs => no encoding.

	* kfmman.cpp (writeEntry): KURL encode/decode fixed.
	  Bookmark files look nicer now.

	* utils.cpp (testNestedURLs): Does no longer assume that
	  a file contains a directory :-) => No longer: "You dropped
	  a file over itself" error messages.

	* kiojob.cpp (link): KURL encode/decode bug fixed.
	             (move): dito
		     (copy): dito
	
Wed Apr 15 19:29:21 1998    <weis@snoopy.rz.uni-frankfurt.de>

	* root.cpp (initFilename): Filenames containing %2f are
	  displayed with '/' ( yet only Root Icons ). This makes
	  bookmark handling much easier.

	* kfmgui.cpp (slotURLEntered): Fixed URL encoding bug

	* kioserver.cpp (isDir): Fixed URL encoding bug

	* kfmprops.cpp (supports): Fixed URL encoding bug

Tue Apr 14 18:22:22 1998    <weis@snoopy.rz.uni-frankfurt.de>

	* kiojob.cpp (processError): Fixed spelling error.

	* kkioslave/http.cpp (ProcessHeader): Reverted changes by Torben Weis,
	  which caused KFM ignore charset setting in Content-Type field of
	  HTTP header.

Sun Mar 29 21:05:16 1998  Martin Jones  <mjones@kde.org>

	* It seemed kfmView::openURL(...) had gained some more parameters.
	  This meant that KHTMLView::openURL( const char *) was no longer
	  overloaded and frames could not be opened.
	  Added a kfmView::openURL( const char *) and frames are happy
	  again.

Sat Mar 28 20:11:50 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* Complete new and cool bookmark management.
	
	* kfmserver.cpp (slotOpenURL): kfmclient openURL trash:/
	  should work now.

Sat Mar 28 11:11:21 1998  Martin Jones  <mjones@kde.org>

	* Added kbooktoken.* so that further changes to the HTML
	  Tokeniser in khtmlw do not break binary compatability in
	  kfm.
	  
Fri Mar 27 02:50:54 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* kfmjob.cpp (slotError): Adaptions for new error
	  handling in kiojob.

	* kiojob.cpp (fatalError): Changed error handling to fix
	  ftp bug. kiojob allows now error filtering before
	  errors are processed by kiojob.

	* kioslave/ftp.cpp (OpenConnection): Special hack for 'list'
	  command. KFM does now no longer assume that a ftp file
	  is a directory.

	* kioslave/ftp_proxy.cpp (Open): Fixed bug in UserAgent tag.

	* kiojob.cpp (start): Added layout management
	  for progress dialogs.

	  appeard with the following line:
	  "Content-Type: text/html; charset=..."

Thu Mar 26 02:40:24 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* kiojob.cpp (completeURL): If the user enters a URL
	  like this one: ftp://user:pass@host. then KFM
	  remebers the password, but does not show it any more.

	* kioslave: Fixed bug that appeard while copying very
	  large files ( >40MB ). Now the progress indicator
	  works as expected.
	
	* kbind.cpp (runBinding): Fixes for %m and %i and %c

	* Added support for middle mouse button. It opens
	  a new window now if that makes sense or acts like
	  the lft mouse button otherwise ( almost ).

Sat Mar 21 17:18:13 1998  Torben Weis  <weis@localhost>

	* kfmgui.cpp (slotShowHistory): KFM can display its history
	  information using the HTML Widget.

	* kfm.cpp (addToHistory): KFM remembers the history
	  of all visited URLs.
	  (saveHTMLHistory): KFM can now save its history
	  to a HTML file.

	* kfmview.cpp (URLVisited): KFM display visited URLs
	  with another color now.

	* KFM remebers the position of the scrollbars again.
	  ( perhaps not everywhere ? )
	
Sat Mar 21 09:21:34 1998  Martin Jones  <mjones@kde.org>

	* Added link overlay to icons.

Fri Mar 13 21:42:15 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* kfmpaths.cpp: don't write the config paths back. I wrote this
	once, but I think, adding them them to the default configuration
	taken $HOME is much better I think. (I struggeled about this some
	times myself working in a network)

1998-03-13  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* kfmview.cpp: fixed a encoding bug for the trash folder.
	(patch by Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@cyber.cs.net.pl>)

Sun Mar  8 13:23:00 1998  Jacek Konieczny  <jajcus@zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl>

	* Added charset mime type parameter support.

Sat Mar  7 12:44:10 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* kkfmoptdlg.cpp: removed the delete statements completly.
	the parent (tabdlg) already deletes them

	* root.cpp: added a decodeURL for the desktop entries

Thu Mar  5 21:32:33 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* several fixes and improvements. Moved a lot of constants to 
	  config-kfm.h 
	* removed the old CHANGES file and replaced it with this standard 
	  format ChangeLog file. Please use emacs/xemacs Meta-x add-change-log-entry
	  to add entries to this log file. Thanks.

03/05/98 Bernd
  - saves the kfmgui sizes on 'save settings'
  - colors of the treeview are now in sync with the colors 
    of the html widget

03/05/98 Bernd
  - configurable root grid sizes
  - fixed up the config/dekstop file. This file was not updated to 
    deal with the new grid root scheme -- no wonder that we got
    complains about the icons not being visible on first start up.


03/04/98 Bernd
  - Introduced a bunch of configuration options: Colors, Fonts, Link Cursor
  - I love it! :-)
  - Stephan please have a look at around line 70 in kkfmoptdlg.cpp
    I had to comment out two delete statements and can't say I understand
    precicely why.
  - several configuration dialogs


18.02.98 Stephan
  - I moved the decoding of path() into KURL and fixed some things concerning
    decoding/encoding.
    Note: I think, kfm still doesn't handle the whole URL issue good enough,
    but to change this, would mean to replace the const char* arguments with
    KURL arguments, I guess


16.02.98 Torben
 - Fixed bug in icon arrangement ( icons should not disappear any more ).
 - Moved unix domain sockets tp /tmp
 - Runs "touch" on the sockets every hour to keep /tmp cleaner daemons away
   from our sockets.
 - Keyboard support: Cursor keys move among the icons ( IconView only ).
                     Space selects/deselects icon
                     Return opens document/directory
                     ESC open popup menu for icon
   Uses the key event handling in KHTMLW. Deleted QAccel in kfmgui


14.02.98 Stephan
  - applied patch by Martin Jones, that fixes the text selection in HTML view
   
12.02.98 Stephan
  - fixed the decoding of Directories, that caused directories named as "asds#sdasd" to
    be shown as permsission denied


25.01.98 Lars Hoss

  - Added support for NoProxyFor and FTP. Patched kioslave to work with the
    new Proxy Manager

22.01.98 Torben
 - Applied "KURL decoding patch" from Henner
 - Fixed empty root icon tooltip
 - Fixed bug in kioslave ( file=0L )
 - Uses UNIX domain sockets now => Communication is 99.99% secure.
   Now KFM should work without any loopback device, too.
 - Use fixed path in kfmsu2. Hardcoded to "/opt/kde". Change if required.
 - Fixed bug in recursive copy/move
 - Fixed memory leak in kiojob.cpp


17.01.98 Torben

 - Fixed Stephans patch
 - Fixed bug in kfmprops that caused too long delays while opening the
   properties dialog. In fact it happend the same as in the above one.
 - Links on the desktop ( links in the unix sense of links ) are displayed
   italic now.
 - Fix for kfmsu2. The display is now set correctly, so KFM can connect to the
   correct one.
 - If you have a link on your desktop and open it, then KFM will use readlink
   to find the destination of the link. This is really needfull, since you
   want for example /home/pub/diplom/text.lyx instead of /home/weis/Desktop/diplom/text.lyx


10.01.98 Stephan

  - take care of .directory, when calculating if Trash is empty


09.01.98 Stephan
  
  - use the Name field out of .kdelnk files or .directory files for entries
    on the desktop
  - copy a .directory file in the created Desktop directories



08.01.98 Torben

 - Fixed bug that causes seg. fault if one tries to delete multiple files.
   This was a VERY ugly one and should make kfm a lot more stable.
 - Spelling mistakes fixed.
 - Fixed hopefully all EINTR bugs
 - Deleting multiple files at once caused multiple updates of one directory.
 - Fixed geometry problem in user dialog

06.01.97 Stephan
 
 - replaced some << constructs with the new function ksprintf
 - fixed a bug in the passwd dialog

06.01.97 Lars Hoss

 - Added dialog for proxy settings.
 - Modified KProtocolHTTP to read its proxy settings from kfmrc.
   The enviroment variable http_proxy is no longer used!


04.01.98 Torben

 - Fixed bug in mounting. Please mention: NEVER put symlinks in fstab.
   This is a correct line:
     /dev/scd0       /cdrom  iso9660 ro,noauto,user,exec     0       0    
   but this one
     /dev/cdrom       /cdrom  iso9660 ro,noauto,user,exec     0       0    
   causes mount to fail on
     mount /dev/cdrom
   since it follows the symlink and can not find /dev/sdc0 in fstab.
   You may never the less enter /dev/cdrom in the KFM properties dialog.
 - Fixed bin in Device.kdelnk. Menu should now only contain one entry
   for mounting.
 - Fixed sprintf bug hopefully anywhere, to allow handling of URLs of any size.
   But not too well tested right now.
 - Applied patch for KURL Completion
 - Fixed bug in mounting dialog. The error message sometimes disappeared.
   Plese notice that some mount implementations are buggy. The do sometimes
   output error messages to stdout instead of stderr, which means that we do
   not catch this error messages.
 - Many small bug fixes
 - Patched KFM for "QString kdedir()". If I get the guy who did this .... grrrrr!!!
   Dragging multiple files to the tree view odes not crash KFM on my system now,
   since this dialog box does no longer appear while a drag is initialized.



18.12.97 Stephan

 - applied patch by Piotr Roszatycki, that added klocale support and 
   accelerators to the property pages



17.12.97 Torben

 - Fixed bug in kioslave that caused tar:/ not to work on Alphas.
 - Now you can no longer delete the current directory. The entry is not any longer
   in the popup menu when you click on the background of a kfm window with the
   right mouse button
 - Popup menus do have pixmaps for the applications now. That looks really cool :-)
 - TreeView shows/hides dot files now
 - Clearing the cache works now
    

15/12/97 David McCanney

 - Changed 'exit.xpm' to 'stop.xpm' in the menubar.  This was confusing some people
   (like me...)
 - Changed Help->Help... to Help->Help
 - Altered the Quit and Delete dialogs so the buttons go [Yes] [No] rather than
   [No] [Yes]  Everyone can stop moaning now :-p

04.12.97 Torben

 - Warning dialog before rearrangig of icons is done
 - It should not be possible any more, to copy files or directories over themselves
   or a directory in one of its children ( at least I hope so :-)
 - Bernhard Leconte applyed some kfmprops layout patch
 - Password is deleted before we show the URL in some warning dialog.
   Before this patch, everyone could see your password if an error occured, ooops :-)
 - Added additional menu entries to directories on desktop. Now they have the same
   popup menus as directories in a KFM window
 - Icons in ~/.kde/share/icons do work as expected now ( they are displayed :-)
 - ftp://weis@localhost shows the home directory of user weis and
   ftp://weis@localhost/ shows the root directory now.
 - Links in tar files are recognized correctly
 - Fixed bug in kfmexec. Works with local files now, too.
 - Does detect fifos and socket disregegarding wether the 'x' flag is set or not.
   And it does not seg fault any more due to such a fifo/socket.
 - Fixed bug in history handling
 - Cache content is saved on exit and reloaded on startup of kfm
 - Extra menu for cache
 - Overview of files in cache is available now, in fact you can use kfm
   as a very cool offline browser now.
 - FTP can handle files with spaces and has no problems with UNIX file system links any more.
 - HTTP Header files "Host:" does now contain the port number is a special
   one is given.
 - You can enter directories in minicli now and KFM will open it
 - if untrusted pages ( http etc. ) contain links to the local file system,
   then a warning is displayed and the action is rejected.


30.11.97 Torben

 - Applied patch from Alessandro Mirone <alex@greco2.polytechnique.fr>
   It fixes problems with the size recognition of some ftp file.
 - Complete rewrite of root icon placing. Fixed many bugs. Now every icon
   is forced to fit into some grid.
 - Changed mounting stuff. Usual users can only edit the device entry in
   the properties dialog, the rest is ignored. Users may only issue
   commands like "mount <device>", that is why they are not asked for
   mount points etc. any more. If you are the root user, then everything
   stays the same
 - Added MP3 to magic file
 - Added static patch from Stefan Westerfeld <stefan@space.twc.de> to
   make things working on AIX
 - Added '-' to kfmsu2 to make it a login shell
 - In the properties dialog you can change the owner only if you are root.
   Everything else does not work anyway.
 - Applied patch from Henner Zeller <zeller@think.de> to allow editing of
   'kpanel swallow' stuff in *.kdelnk files
 - Added Stefan Westerfeld <stefan@space.twc.de> to the list of authors.
 - Directory Tree does now offer home_directory, desktop_dir and root
   in level 0
 - Items in directory tree are sorted now
 - If KFM calls other apps it uses for example 'file:/home/weis/file.gz#gzip:/'
   instead of '/home/weis/file.gz#gzip:/', but it still says '/home/weis/file'
   for local files without subprotocol
 - If files from the desktop are moved to the trash bin, then existing files
   in the trashcan are going to be overwritten wthout bothering the user first.
 - Tooltips on root icons
 - Changing the font will force the root icons to update => no more display errors
    
22.10.97, Torben

 - Added Henner's URL completion mode
 - Applied patch to kfmman's word wrap function ( Thanks to Paul Kendal )
 - Changed behaviour of "File->Run"
 - Added IconLoader to "class KFM", patches KfmProperties to work with this class
 - Added Henners patch for properties dialog. Permissions are now a joy to change :-)
 - Removed seg faulting when clicking on URL links on the desktop
 - Applied patch to make kfm compile on ALPHAS smoothly
