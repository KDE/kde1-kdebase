About kdelibs
-------------

This is the version 1.1.2 release of the KDE base distribution.  Included
in this collection of applications are some generally useful programs such
as a file manager, terminal emulation program, and programs to configure
all of the K Desktop Environment.

Common Mistakes
---------------

IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory where KDE is
installed.  Please set this in your login file.

If XPM support wasn't configured, it may be that configure has no idea
where your XPM libraries are.  If so, set XPM_INCLUDE and XPM_LDFLAGS to
the paths where configure should look for XPM.  But if you haven't
installed XPM or it didn't come with your system, that's no problem.  You
will only miss a few screensavers.  The same thing applies with OPENGL
support.  Here you have to set GL_INCLUDE and GL_LDFLAGS.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 1.42.

If you get TOC overflow errors on AIX, and are using gcc 2.7.2, you'll
need to add -mminimal-toc to your CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

Be advised, if you're using FreeBSD and the ill-designed port of Qt that
comes along with it, this is not a good idea.  The KDE does not, and will
not depend on Mesa or any other implementations of OpenGL.  If you have
any further questions on the subject please contact Andreas Klemm
<andreas@klemm.gtn.com>.

If you would like to include "C2" style secure encryption, define
HAVE_OSF_C2_PASSWD in config.h, and link kcheckpass with the appropiate
libraries.  This has been tested on Digital Unix, which requires the
security library.

Configuring
-----------

kdebase's configure script supports all the standard GNU autoconf options
(you can have the various options listed for you by specifying the --help
switch), plus the following options are also supported.  Note:  the *non*
default variation is listed, so if you see --enable-debug, the default is
--disable debug.

`--x-includes=DIR'
     use X include files in DIR

`--x-libraries=DIR'
     use X library files in DIR

`--enable-debug'
     creates debugging code [default=no]

`--enable-strict'
     Add strict[er] compiler options (may not work!) to the CFLAGS and
     CXXFLAGS.  This is GNU CC specific for the time being.

`--with-gnu-ld'
     assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]

`--disable-libtool-lock'
     force libtool not to do file locking

`--disable-nls'
     do not use Native Language Support (i18n)

`--with-qt-dir'
     where the root of qt is installed 

`--with-qt-includes=DIR'
     look for the Qt header files in DIR

`--with-qt-libraries=DIR'
     look for the Qt library in DIR

`--with-extra-includes=DIR'
     look for include files in DIR in addition to any other
     `standard' paths

`--with-extra-libs=DIR'
     look for [extra] libraries in DIR too

`--disable-path-check'
     don't try to make sure that kdebase is installed into the same
     base KDE directory as the rest of KDE
 
`--with-install-root=DIR'
     the root to install to [default=/] (i.e. make / == DIR, so /usr
     becomes DIR/usr)

`--disable-rpath'
     do not use the rpath feature of ld

`--with-xdmdir=DIR'
     use xdm (and config files) from DIR if the xdm config dir can't be
     found automaticly

`--with-pam[=ARG]'
     enable support for PAM: ARG=[yes|no|service name]

`--with-shadow'
     if you want to check for and use shadow password support if it's present

`--without-gl'
     disable any software which depends on OpenGL

`--without-xpm'
     disable color pixmap XPM tests

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since
nothing is perfect, and this this makes debugging things a whole lot
easier.

Upgrading
---------

If you have an older kdebase installed, just copy all your .k*rc files
from $HOME to $HOME/.kde/config. In the other case, default values are
used for most apps.

Removal/Uninstallation
----------------------

You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completely, and is depreciated.

More Info
---------

If your system does not have XPM installed, you may obtain it from
ftp://avahi.inria.fr/pub/xpm, or you may find it in
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles

If your system supports PAM (Plugable Authentication Modules), please see
the README.pam file in this directory for more information about using KDE
with PAM.

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you would like to find
out more about a specific application included in kdebase.

Please direct any bug reports to http://bugs.kde.org.

If you have problems compiling and installing this package, please contact
Stephan Kulow <coolo@kde.org>.

If you have discovered a security problem with KDE, or any of its included
programs or libraries,

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
