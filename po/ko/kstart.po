" Utility to launch legay applications with special KDE window properties\n"
" such as iconified, maximized, a certain virtual desktop, a special "
"decoration\n"
" or sticky. Furthermore you can exclude the window from getting the focus.\n"
" \n"
" In addition, the -activate switch will jump to the window even if it is\n"
" started on a different virtual desktop\n"
" \n"
" Usage:\n"
" %s <command> [-window <regular expression>] [-desktop <number>]\n"
"              [-sticky] [-iconify] [-maximize] \n"
"              [-decoration tiny|none] [-activate] [-nofocus]\n"
" \n"
" If you do not specify a regular expression for the windows title,\n"
" then the very first window to appear will be taken. Not recommended!\n"
" \n"
" Example usage:\n"
" %s \"xclock -geometry 80x80-0+0\" -window xclock \\\n"
"        -decoration tiny -sticky -nofocus\n"
" puts a tiny decorated, sticky xclock on the top right corner of the "
"screen,\n"
" that does not even get focus (and therefore has no entry in the taskbar).\n"
" Note that you can still close it with the right mouse button.\n"
