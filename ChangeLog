1998-04-06  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: don't test compiling, linking, running in
	one step. This proved to be too dangerous for my mail box.
	
1998-03-21  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* libtool.m4.in: created some new macros to work around this 
	ugly (because long) help of configure --enable-shared/static

1998-03-05  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: set language to C++ before trying the ksize_t 
	test

	* configure.in: sorted the Makefile entries alphabeticly (and all 
	together: we love xemacs! we love xemacs! ;)
	
	* configure.in: added sk 

	* acinclude.m4.in: substitute x_libraries to fix the empty -rpath
	
1998-03-03  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: add a rpath for every shared library, that is 
	linked too (especially X11 libraries)
	
Tue Feb 24 22:04:59 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: added kde_sounddir and set kde_minidir to
	kde_icondir/mini to break not too much

Sun Feb 15 18:25:50 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* configure.in: added bugfix by Bob Miller <kbob@engr.sgi.com>
	(correct reset of IFS)
	
Wed Feb 11 00:53:11 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* configure.in: made shadow under Linux default, since the
	binaries will work also under non-shadow systems. The only problem 
	left is PAM, so I disabled shadow in case, PAM is present

Tue Feb 10 16:46:32 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* configure.in: added test for nice to find out, if the option
	-nice works for the screensavers

	* acinclude.m4.in: port to LynxOS. For this I moved all library
	search routines in KDE_MISC_TESTS, so I don't need to write this
	in every package

	* README: some grammar fixes

	* acinclude.m4.in: search for the libs in the exec_prefix, when
	it's present
	
Sun Feb  8 14:07:23 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: updated all packages

	* libtool.m4.in: applied patch for libtool.m4.in to show the
	correct default for shared and static
	

Sat Feb  7 10:56:00 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* configure.in: good news - KDE is relocatable again.

	* libtool.m4.in: updated to latest libtool 1.0i

Fri Feb  6 21:26:51 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: added a AC_PROVIDE for AC_PROG_CC and
	AC_PROG_CPP to KDE_CHECK_COMPILERS

Thu Feb  5 16:27:47 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: put $QTDIR/bin before /usr/bin in the path to
	look for moc. I don't know why, but I got a report, that configure
	found /usr/bin/moc under Solaris

Fri Jan 30 15:47:50 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: export LIBRARY_PATH after reset to the saved
	value
	
	* acinclude.m4.in: unset the LIBRARY_PATH to get a relieable
	result when trying to find, if Qt compiles without -L

Sat Jan 24 00:45:52 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: fixed another bug in AC_PATH_KDE

Thu Jan 22 14:46:15 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* configure.in: fixed an ugly bug in AC_BASE_PATH_KDE

	* kappfinder/kappfinder.in: let kappfinder create by configure to
	allow the use of the kde_ paths

Wed Jan 21 22:19:35 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in: - added a install_root prefix to all paths, if
	set, to enable package managers to move the whole installation at once
	- added --with-install-root to set the install_root prefix

Tue Jan 20 22:41:04 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* configure.in: added NOOPT_CXXFLAGS to allow kioslave to be
	compiled without -O2

Mon Jan 19 21:55:21 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* configure.in: some little fixes for the Makefiles

	* acinclude.m4.in: --prefix will no longer override the search for 
	libraries. If they are present somewhere, they are used (through
	the methodes in KApplication)

Mon Jan 12 00:30:36 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in fixed an ugly bug, that accoured, when
	qt_libraries is not set (empty/equals X11/not necessary)
	
	* acinclude.m4.in moved the remove of the files after the error
	detection 
	

Sun Jan 11 17:27:53 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4.in added a new macro KDE_CHECK_QT_DIRECT to unset
	the Qt library path, if a Qt program compiles without them
		
	* acinclude.m4.in added a return value in the CREATE_KFSSTND
	macro. Perhaps this has caused the problems

Sat Jan 10 17:40:44 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* ChangeLog started to maintain a ChangeLog file again
	* acinclude.m4.in the AC_CREATE_KFSSTND to get better debug output
	to find the problem
