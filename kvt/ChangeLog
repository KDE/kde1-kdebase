Harri Porten - 12/07/99

  - fixed segfault resulting from `kvt -e' without a trailing command

Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel - 08/06/99
 
  - fixed root privilege handling 
  - fixed security hole in "New Terminal" menu entry
  - added Unix98 pty support

  (problem report thanks to Olaf Kirch <okir@caldera.de>)

Carsten Pfeiffer - 10/1/99
  - fixed commandline options not restored properly restored on 
    sessionmanagement
  - removed one commandline substition (-caption -> -T), that was done twice

Alex Zepeda - 1/1/99
  - removed all C++ style comments in command.c
  - properly #ifdef'd the inline #define.

since kvt-0.18.6	
  - fixed a few compiler warnings (mweilguni@kde.org)
  - configureable menu shortcuts for the root menu items (needed for some
    programs, because Alt-(H|F|O) are often used as accelerator keys.
	
since kvt-0.18.5
  - Now the Terminal-Dialog exchanges the meaning of Backspace and Delete
    This prevents us from having two Delete-keys and no Backspace-key (bmg)
  - a Patch for FreeBSD from Kevin Street <street@iName.com>
    FreeBSD has setupterm in libmytinfo (bmg)
  - HAVE_SETUPTERM used (bmg)
  - Now kvt searches again a list of TERM-entries and takes the first
    (`best') available.  This should minimize problems with
    unincomplete or antiquated terminfo/termcap databases. (This is
    based on curses.) (bmg)
 - changed the layouting of the terminal-dialog. (bmg)

since kvt-0.18.4
 - added a hack for stupid clients like pine who cannot handle "\n"
    in selections but need "\r"   (Matthias)
 - fixes for VMS (Andrew Phillips)

since kvt-0.18.3
  - fixed a bug that made it impossible to resize the window with the
    menu when the window size was manipulated with the normal window
    manager resize mechanism (Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>)
  - removed some DOS-newlines (^M), which cause compile errors on
    some compilers (Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>)
  - fixed "New Terminal" (Matthias)
  - fixed scrollbar repositioning (relied on some old qt side effect) (Matthias)

since kvt-0.18.2
  - fixed SM again (Jens stuff was broken, probably I applied the patch
     wrong. Anyways I redid it with C++ and Qt)   (Matthias)
  - tiny fix for "-meta" with missing argument (Matthias)

since kvt-0.18.1
  - save command line parameters into kvtrc (Jens Jahny)
  - restore process with all command line parameters (Jens Jahny)
  - fixed tab order in terminal dialog (Mario Weilguni)
  - small fix for the -geometry option (Matthias)
  - ported cut and paste to QClipboard since it made sometimes trouble
    in combination with certain applications (Matthias)
	  

since kvt-0.18:
  - Custom Colors (Bernd Wuebben)	
  - mouse selection more xterm-like	
  - alpha patches (Uwe Thiem)
  - patchlevel 1 to clearify upload confusions due to demeter.
  - compiles under X11R5 again (Juergen Schumacher)


since kvt-0.17:
  - modifications and enhancements to keyboard handling: now kvt is quite 
    compatible with a decent xterm (which itself is very vt-220 like).
    This includes control sequences, numpad  and dead-key support. (Matthias)
  - cleaned up the distribution. Also added LICENSE.readme (Matthias)
  - new color scheme "KDE". Looks similar to modern xterms. (Matthias)
  - small fixes for the "Terminal Options" dialog (Matthias)
  - new cgi-sequence "X" for erase char. (Matthias)
  - uses kapp's help menu (Matthias)
  - enabled "-caption" (Matthias)
  - session management (Matthias)
  - re-arranged help menu (Matthias)
	
since kvt-0.16:
  - added user-configurable backspace (^H/^?)
    (Jeroen van der Most <jvdmost@wi.leidenuniv.nl>)
  - bugfixed in DnD handling
  - added localisation of messages
  - bugfixes in color handling
  - added option `-linux' to set up a linux-console conformal kvt.
    made underline possible in linux-color-mode.
  - bugfixes in color handling
  - added a "Linux Console" color-entry.
  - Now kvt searches a list of TERM-entries and takes the first
    (`best') available.  This should minimize problems with
    unincomplete or antiquated terminfo/termcap databases. (This is
    based on curses.)
	No loner true! Why? Where has this patch gone?! (Matthias)
  - added a linux-console compatible color-mode (M G Berberich)

since kvt-0.15:

  - segfault with open menus fixed
  - exit segfault with a floating menubar fixed
	
since kvt-0.14:
	
  - keyboard accelerators for the menus (Cedric Maion)
  - added a minimumSize();
  - fixed the tiny "huge"-bug 
  - Class of characters that form a word can be extenden by the user
    (M G Berberich)
  - Option -vt_geometry now work's again. (M G Berberich)
  - Doubleclick selects wordwise, trippleclick selects linewise
    (M G Berberich)
  - various sizes (M G Berberich) 
  - selection works with all keymasks now
  - drag'n'drop (Christian Esken)
  - small fixes for FreeBSD (Marc van Kempen)
  - new option "-tn" for terminal type
  - background white leads to lightgrey for applications.
    This allows dialog-programms to look nice (e.g. LISA)
  - bugfixes in the event loop. First version that seems to work properly :) 
  - black-on-black fixed: now black-on-white if a 
    color allocation fails
  - multiline selection fixed again
  - scrollbar problems fixed 
  - should compile on Linux/Alpha now (Christian Czezatke)
  - fixed the multiline selection again
  - kdisplays changes gets recognized during runtime now
  - small bugfix for backspace
  - greater bugfix for eventhandling (fix of the deep-bug fix)
  - usage of KApplication::invokeHTMLHelp(...)
  - kvt_version.h

since kvt-0.13:
  - fixed all the bugs introduced by the multiline selection
    patch
  - fixed a very deep bug which was there since the early times
    of kvt. In fact the hand-in-hand working between the old
    rxvt main loop and Qt's main loop was broken. This bug was
    reponsible for occasional missunderstandings of terminal-sequences.
	
since kvt-0.12
  - hopefully fixed kvt's pasting speed to Motif applications	
  - kvt can now handle multiline selections without breaking them into
    multiple lines

since kvt-0.11
   - kvt should work ok with TERM=xterm-color now!

     This means fixed Home/End and BackSpace/Delete handling, fixed
     colorhandling, new cursor-visibility sequences, some other new
     sequences ....  In fact Xemacs  works great now inside a kvt: 
     korrect keybindings and nice syntaxhighlighting :-)
     Also the S.u.S.E yast works fine and colorful now. And the midnight
     commaner, too. :-))

   - a few deep rxvt bugfixes

  - if you install kvt-color (see instructions in ./etc/) there is also
     support for ACS_BLOCK and ACS_BOARD. This makes for
     example the scrollbar of yast visible (but you need TERM=kvt-color for
     that!) Another way would be to replace your xterm-color definitions with
     those in ./etc/xterm-color

  - new command line option "-no_scrollbar"

since kvt-0.10:
  - login shell no longer default
  - TERM="xterm-color" no longer default, but "vt100". This is good
    enough, supports colors and most termcaps in this world will
    be able to deal with it. 
  - no more hanging kvt windows after terminating the command process
    (for example leaving a shell with "exit")
  - includes a KDE Desktop Entry and a nice UNIX.xpm Icon 
    (heavily inspired by Mark's window_list.xpm)
  - invokes kdehelp from Help->Help
  - contains a dummy kvt.html file
  - slightly improved Imakefile and a Makefile.install for installation
	
since kvt-0.9:
  - hopefully fixed a visibility notify problem (I had to disable some
     performance optimization of rxvt, but this is hardly noticable)

since kvt-0.8:
  - bugfixes in focus handling.
  - rstyle is set to DEFAULT_RSTYLE after any color-changes
    from the menu. With this you can reset weird colors.
  - kvt is a derived KApplication yet, that means it also writes
    its configuration into a ".kvtrc" now.
  - "help" item in the menubar, with "About kvt" and "Help"
  - kvt now sets QWidget::setSizeIncrement(..). That means it scales
    similar to rxvt or xterm in steps that are defined by the used charset.
    (Although this doesn't work yet with kwm-0.3.1, but fvwm understands it)
                                              (Matthias)

since kvt-0.7:
  - removed some silly debug messages that I forgot
  - made the escape sequences for changing the window-title
    and the icon-name work again.
    For example: "^[]2 New Window Title ^G"
  - also re-enabled the command line options for these tasks
    ("-T" for window-title and "-n" for the icon-name)
  - the window-title is automatically set to the command's
    name if one is specified with "-e command"
  - New command line option "-no_menubar". This overrides the
    default from the .kderc file (May be usable for an error console)
                                              (Matthias)
	
since kvt-0.6:
  - checked out rxvt-2.18... oops, they changed a lot.
    In fact it doesn't seem too easy to add all these additions
    to kvt :( (I hope that an application like kvt will become
    completly irrelevant in the near future with the KDE Desktop
    Environment for more komplex task anyway. And running a simple shell
    is OK with the current kvt, so it may fit our needs)
    Anyway the etc/ folder may make some sense.
    kvt yet also compiles with "TERM=xterm-color" as default
  - fixed the "-e" bugs. In fact these have been rxvt-2.08 bugs that occured
    with login_shell enabled ("-ls"). Since kvt has this as default, the bug
    occured always with kvt, except you invoke it with "-ls-".
    If just had a look into rxvt-2.18 and build their fixes into kvt,
    what is still possible with a few renames.
    Another fix is, that Qt won't see the options following after "-e"
    anymore.
  - fixed the "-geometry"-bug. Yet the vt windows geometry can be set
    with for example -vt_geometry "130x40"
  - removed some obsolete command line options from rxvt.
  - new command line option vt_size <tiny|small|normal|large|huge>
                                              (Matthias)
	
since kvt-0.5:
- "new terminal" keeps command line options 
- small workaround for a resize-problem
                                              (Matthias)
	
since kvt-0.4:
- settings can be saved via KConfig (libkde-0.3) by 
  invoking Options->Save_Options
- scrollbarwidth/height reduced to 16
- right-mouse-options-popup remains visible after a 
  click without drag
- minor bugfixes (for example cursor-recolering)
- removed some hacks for qt-1.0. This also means 
  kvt-0.5 needs qt >= 1.1
                                              (Matthias)


since kvt-0.3:
- minor bugfixes (also fixed the pixel-garbage
  that rxvt sometimes left on the screen)
- renamed "Terminal" to "File". Still not sure about this.  
                                              (Matthias)
                  

since kvt-0.2:

- keyhandling and focushandling improved, i.e. usable
- new scrollbar-options for Matt and all the
  other UNIX-hackers used to left scrollbars on 
  terminals :-)
- shift-Page[Up,Down] also works now.
- "Secure keyboard" feature available via options-menu.
- renamed "File" to "Terminal" since there aren't any files.
  Is this OK with the style-guide?
                                              (Matthias)

since rxvt:

- renamed the stuff to kvt
- removed all graphics code
- removed all scrollbar code
- broke the event loop
- let the stuff run in the Qt-Event loop
- added a nice scrollbar, several menus  and a frame
- several minor changes to make the switch possible
                                              (Matthias)


2.06 to 2.07
        1. Fixed problems with rxvt screwing up tty permisssions (?)
2.03 to 2.06
        1. Fixed a limit which imposed a maximum width for the
	   terminal window of 255 characters. There is no limit now.
	2. Made provision for applications to get mouse-click feedback
	   when user clicks in a graphics window. See graphics_sample
2.02 to 2.03
	1. Fixed memory management just a little.

2.0 to 2.02
	1. Bug fixes for color and graphics.

1.97 to 2.0
	1. Added ANSI color support. Compile with -DCOLOR
	2. Added a graphics mode. Compile with -DGRAPHICS
1.96 to 1.97
	1. Bug in refresh() which was causing slow refreshes after
	   clear-screens was fixed. Showed up during emacs start-up.

1.95 to 1.96
	1. rxvt did bad things if it received mouse - Motion events
	   without a preceeding button-press. Fixed.
1.94 to 1.95
        1. Created a substitute for XGetDefaults, which seemed to account
	   for 1/2 to 2/3 of the memory used by rxvt (according to the
	   SIZE field of ps output). My substitute only reads the
	   .Xdefaults file. Compile with -DFAKE_RESOURCES to get my mini-
	   XDefaults handling, -DREAL_RESOURCES to keep XGetDefault.

1.93 to 1.94
	1. Fixed some minor long-standing errors in the vt100 emulation.
	2. Fixed ALT-<char> handling in command.c
	3. Fixed minor bug with start-of-selection location.
	4. Added xterm-type "extend selection" feature using
	   mouse button 3. Button 1 always starts a new selection. Button3
	   tries to extend the current selection if possible.
	5. Fixed problem with bold-face fonts overflowing into
	   the next character for some fonts.

1.92 to 1.93
	1. ran gprof to find bottle-necks in the code. Halved user
	   time, but had little effect on total time required to
	   update the display. Seems worth keeping for the more efficient
	   user-time, though. At this point, I think that most of the elapsed
	   time is spent waiting for input or waiting for the X buffers
	   to flush.
	2. Used to refresh the screen every 2.2 screen-fulls during
	   flat-out scrolling. Really cuts down on scroll-time. Now,
	   refresh every screen-full (or when there's a pause in activity),
	   but when flat-out scrolling starts, decrease the refresh period,
	   so that its every 10th screenful after a little while. This has
	   no noticeable visible effect, since the scrolling text is
	   absolutely unintelligible anyway, but will improve the scroll
	   "feel" when doing just one or two screenfulls, ie in an ls -l.
	3. Surrounded  the code which uses XCopyArea with #ifdef's
	   I have never seen this help performance, but I think that there
	   may be some video-systems which benefit from this, particularly
	   in a full-screen editor or slow scrolling type of setting.
	4. Performance in flat out scrolling, text only, on a sparc-10,
	   displaying rxvt on an HDS x-terminal:
		nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time rxvt -e cat k
		        6.1 real         3.1 user         2.5 sys
		nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time xterm -e cat k
		       40.8 real         4.6 user         3.4 sys

1.91 to 1.92
	1. Added greek-keyboard support patches.
1.90 to 1.91
	1. assorted minor patches
1.85 to 1.90 
	1. assorted minor patches
1.82 to 1.85
	1. Fixed ESC c handling.
	2. Fixed minor selection handling bug.

1.81 to 1.82
	1. Fixed slow refresh during selection process
	2. Fixed problem of not correctly clearing selections of
	   1 character.

1.80 to 1.81
	1. Fixed some scrolling problems, problems with
	   partially obscured windows.
        2. Added some neat debugging capability in debug.c
        3. Patched up rclock.

1.74 to 1.80

	1. Fixed core dump from selecting past the bottom of the screen
	2. Fixed a few escape sequences, per the vttest program
	3. Broke and fixed handling of moved/resize/new-font handling.
	4. Still can't change tab stops correctly.
        5. Ran vt-100 test suite. Added capability to change tab stops
	   and enter reverse video, and to switch from 80 to 132
	   columns and back. Fixed a seg-fault in scroll().

	
1.70 to 1.74
	1. Fixed cursor drawing errors.
	2. Improved smoothness of scroll-back operations.
	3. Applied some SVR4 patches.
	4. Applied HPUX patches, and a few cursor display patches
	5. Fixed up font-changing routines a bit.
	6. Fixed a scrolling problem for windows taller than the scroll-back
	   buffer.

1.6 to 1.7
        1. Fixed the problem with random rendition flags in the scroll
	   back buffer
	2. Fiddled with re-drawing on the scroll-bar, and with
	   how often refreshing occurs.
	3. Incorporated some AIX patches.
	4. Included #ifdef'd changes to support vt100 printer.
        5. Fixed send_string routine, so that it doesn't loose
	   data.
	6. Complete re-write of screen.c
1.5 to 1.6
	1. Removed all use of a seperate bold font. Now uses
	   over-striking exclusively.
	2. Added some more optimizations for drawing speed when
	   the window is re-sized or moved.
        3. Implemented speed ups in screen.c

1.47 to 1.48
	1. Cleaned up re-drawing on expose events, so rxvt only
	   re-draws the newly exposed parts of the screen.
        2. Fixed backspace, which must have broken in 1.45.
	3. Added command line option of iconic startup.

from 1.45 to 1.47
	1. Incorporated improved bsd utmp handling from 
           dperry@ringer.cs.utsa.edu (David Perry)
	2. Fixed a very minor bug where the solid-cursor can leave a
	   a bit of a ghost when you resize the window. Its stupid,
	   but it always bothered me.

from 1.4 to 1.45

	1.  Fixed scrolling error when switching to larger fonts
	2.  Fixed utmp-entry removal for SYSV type systems.
	3.  Icorportated patches for FreeBSD and
