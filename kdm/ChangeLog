	* kdmshutdown.cpp :
	Changed char[] to QString. We want unicode ;)

1998-12-16 Duncan Haldane <f.d.m.haldane@cwix.com>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp : 
	(1) made the PAM service name configurable
	if KDE_PAM_SERVICE is defined (if not, it is "xdm"). (This
	should have been done when I did this to verify.c a while
	back).
	
	(2) Added a extra line to the shutdown dialog box
	"(Enter Root password") if it is in "RootOnly" mode.

	(3) Changed the confusing description of the "exit xdm" button
	to "Restart X server", which is the actual function of the
	third button.

	* Make the authentication cookie more unpredictable by adding
