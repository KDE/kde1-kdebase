<sect>Introduction

<p>
KWrite is a text editor for the KDE Desktop. It could be a
programmer's editor best used in conjunction with kfm for source file
browsing for different languages. KWrite may also serve well for
composition of small plain text documents. It is meant to be a
programmers editor, and it could be considered as a partial
alternative to more powerful editors such as XEmacs or Emacs. KWrite's
main functionality feature is the colorized syntax assured for many
programming languages: C/C++, Java, Python, Perl, Bash, Modula 2,
HTML, Ada.

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KWrite
<p>
KWrite is a core application of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KWrite can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KWrite, you need the latest versions of <tt> libkdecore</tt>
and <tt> libkfm</tt>. All required libraries as well as KWrite itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KWrite on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KWrite distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Since KWrite uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing lists.

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>

KWrite is very simply to use. I am sure that if you have ever used a text edit you 
will have no problems with KWrite. 

<p>
<sect1>Drag and Drop
<p>
KWrite makes use of the KDE Drag and Drop protocol. This means that you can darg
and drop files form the Desktop or kfm or some remote ftp site that you have
open in one of kfm's windows on to KWrite. 

<sect1>Editing files on the internet
<p>
You can open and save files transparently on the internet. Try the the following at the
command-line prompt to see an example of this.

<tscreen><verb>
% kwrite ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/Welcome.msg
</verb></tscreen>

KWrite doesn't support printing yet.
