Version 0.0.6

Bernd: Implemented support for all sound events and polished the whole
thing up.

Version 0.0.5 (Jan. 9th, 1997)

- Fixed a bug that caused "KApplication::kdedir" to be
  overwritten. (Cast it to "const char *" before assignment
  since this forces QString to make a deep copy).

Version 0.0.4 (Nov. 24th, 1997)

No changes in kwmsound, only to syssound

Version 0.0.3 (Nov. 22nd, 1997)

- Added support for Enabling/Disabling system sounds by the setting
  GlobaSettings/EnableSounds.

- kwmsound uses the "KApplication::getConfig" now. In order to assure
  that kwmsound actually re-reads its config-file when syssound
  changes it, a call to "reparseConfiguration" has been added

Version 0.0.2 (Oct. 21st, 1997)

- Made the placement of the configuration file compliant
  with the new KDE convention. The sound configuration
  is now stored in $HOME/.kde/share/config/kwmsoundrc    

- The startup sound is now played back at program startup
  and not based on the reception of a "init" signal from the WM.
  So you're now guaranteed to ge the "Startup" sound to 
  hear... ;-)
